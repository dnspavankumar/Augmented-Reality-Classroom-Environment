## Files Modified

### 1. **API Routes**

#### `src/app/api/ai/route.js`
- **Before**: Japanese translation service (English → Japanese)
- **After**: Science/Math Q&A service
- **New Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Brief answer...",
    "explanation": [
      {
        "step": "Step name",
        "description": "Step description",
        "keyPoints": ["point 1", "point 2"]
      }
    ],
    "formula": "Optional formula"
  }
  ```

#### `src/app/api/tts/route.js`
- **Before**: Japanese voices (ja-JP-NanamiNeural/NaokiNeural)
- **After**: English voices (en-US-JennyNeural/GuyNeural)
- **Note**: Teacher names remain "Nanami" and "Naoki" but are mapped to English voices

---

### 2. **State Management**

#### `src/hooks/useAITeacher.js`
- Removed: `furigana`, `setFurigana`, `english`, `setEnglish`, `speech`, `setSpeech`
- Kept: Teacher names as ["Nanami", "Naoki"] (to match existing 3D model files)
- Modified: `askAI` function to work with new API format
- Modified: `playMessage` to use `message.answer.answer` instead of Japanese text

---

  - Question display (Q:)
  - Answer display (A:)
  - Detailed explanation with steps
  - Key points list
  - Formula display section

- **Updated**:

#### `src/components/BoardSettings.jsx`
- **Removed**:
  - Furigana toggle button
  - English toggle button
  - Formal/Casual speech buttons
  
- **Kept**:
  - Teacher selection (Nanami/Naoki)
  - Classroom layout selection

#### `src/components/TypingBox.jsx`
- **Updated**:
  - Title: "How to say in Japanese?" → "Ask Your Question"
  - Description: Now mentions science, math, physics, chemistry, biology
  - Placeholder: "Have you ever been to Japan?" → "What is photosynthesis?"

#### `src/app/layout.js`
- **Updated Metadata**:
  - Title: "AI Sensei" → "AI Teacher - Science & Math Tutor"
  - Description: Updated to reflect new purpose

---

### 4. **Documentation**

#### `README.md`
- Completely rewritten with:
  - New project description
  - Feature list
  - Technology stack
  - Setup instructions
  - Environment variables needed

## Teacher Names

### ✅ No Changes Required
The teacher names **Nanami** and **Naoki** have been kept as-is because:
- The 3D model files are named `Teacher_Nanami.glb` and `Teacher_Naoki.glb`
- The animation files are named `animations_Nanami.glb` and `animations_Naoki.glb`
- The existing images are `Nanami.jpg` and `Naoki.jpg`

### Voice Mapping
While the names remain Japanese, they now speak English:
- **Nanami** → `en-US-JennyNeural` (Female English voice)
- **Naoki** → `en-US-GuyNeural` (Male English voice)

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the application**:
   - Ask a science question: "What is photosynthesis?"
   - Ask a math question: "What is the Pythagorean theorem?"
   - Try different subjects: physics, chemistry, biology
   - Test the audio playback feature (English voices)
   - Switch between teachers (Nanami/Naoki)
   - Try different classroom layouts

3. **Verify**:
   - Questions are answered in English
   - Explanations are broken down into steps
   - Formulas are displayed when relevant
   - Text-to-speech works with English voices
   - No Japanese text appears anywhere
